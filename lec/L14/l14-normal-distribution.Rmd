### Learning objectives for today
- Learn about a Normal distribution centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation of $\sigma$
- Learn about the standard Normal ($\mu=0 \text{ and }  \sigma=1$)
- Perform simple calculations by hand using the 68-95-99.7 rule
- Calculate probabilies above, below or within given values in a normal distribution
- Calculate the quantile for a specified cummulative probability for any normal distribution
- Understand and compute Z-scores

## Statistics is everywhere

### Height and success
```{r, out.width="60%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("independentheight.png")
```

### What type of problem is this 
Remembering back to our PPDAC framework....

What kind of questions are these studies asking?

### Counterfactual

Frayling, one of the study authors said:

>"if you took the same man - say a 5ft 10in man and make him 5ft 7in - and sent him through life, he would be about £1,500 worse off per year” 


### Were there important confounders?

This study was published in BMJ (Height, body mass index, and socioeconomic status: Mendelian randomization study in UK Biobank BMJ 2016; 352 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i582 (Published 08 March 2016))

They used mendelian randomization to avoid confounding - and put a DAG in their paper to illustrate

### DAG 

![Study DAG](F1.large.jpg)

### Proposed mechansim

One hypothesized mechanism for the influence of height on success is that those who are perceived as taller than normal experience positive social bias.   

&nbsp;  

But wait.... what does "taller than normal" mean?


### Three relevant Definitions of Normal (Mirriam-Webster)

1: Conforming to a type, standard , or regular pattern

2: of, relating to, or characterized by average intelligence or development

**3: relating to, involving, or being a normal curve or normal distribution**




## Probability Distributions

### Empirical vs Theoretical

 - probabilities calculated from a finite amount of observed data are called **Empirical** probabilities
 - probabilities based on theoretical functions are called **Theoretical Probability Distributions**

### Empirical distributions

What was the empirical distribution we used to visualize a continuous variable in part I of the class?

What did we look at when summarizing continuous variables visually and numerically?


How might we summarize height?

### Empirical distribution of height
Height is a continuous variable so we summarize height in a sample with:

  - Measure of **central tendancy** 
    - mean
    - median
    - mode
  - Measure of **variability/spread**
    - standard deviation
    - IQR
  - Visually we would look to see if the distribution is
    - Unimodal
    - symmetric
  
 
### Why are we interested in theoretical distributions?
- Theoretical distributions apply probability theory to describe the behavior of a random variable
- For continuous variables (like height) this allows us to predict the probability associated with a range of values
- They help us answer questions about what is "normal" if by "normal" we essentially mean what is expected

## The Normal Distribution

### The Normal distribution
![Carl Friedrick Gauss](gauss.png)

### Function for Normal Distribution
The underlying function which generates a probability distribution for a Normal distribution is:


```{r, out.width="60%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("densitynormal.png")
```



You do NOT need to remember this
However you should know that the distribution is defined by two parameters, the mean and standard deviation, and that all the values under the curve must total to 1 (the probability space here is the area under the curve)

### The Normal Distribution N(0,1)

- Here is a Normal distribution with mean ($\mu$) = 0, standard deviation ($\sigma$) = 1 .

```{r load-libraries2, echo=F, out.width = "70%", warning=F, message=F}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(latex2exp)
library(dplyr)

#students, you don't need to know how to use stat_function()
p1 <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), col = "orange") +
  labs(y = "density") + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 0, y = 0.45), label = "mean = 0 \nsd = 1", check_overlap = T, col = "orange") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-5, 5)) + theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

p1
```

### The Normal Distribution N(0,1) and N(2,1)
- Let's add another Normal distribution, this one centered at 2, with the same
standard deviation

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
p1 <- p1 + stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 2, sd = 1), col = "blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 0.45), label = "mean = 2 \nsd = 1", check_overlap = T, col = "blue") 
p1
```

### The Normal Distribution N(O,1) and N(2,1) and N(-2,0.5)

- Let's add a third Normal distribution, this one centered at -2, with a standard
deviation of 0.5

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
p1 <- p1 + stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = -2, sd = 0.5), col = "forest green")  +
  geom_text(aes(x = -2, y = 0.85), label = "mean = -2 \nsd = 0.5", check_overlap = T, col = "forest green") 
p1
```

### The Normal Distribution

- Notice what happens when we make the standard deviation smaller (i.e., the spread is reduced)
- Why is the distribution "taller"?

### The Normal Distribution

- Can you guess what a Normal distribution with $\mu=1$ and $\sigma=2.5$ would
look like compared to the others?

### The Normal Distribution

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
p1 <- p1 + stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 1, sd = 1.5))  +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 0.3), label = "mean = 1 \nsd = 2.5", check_overlap = T) 
p1
```

### Properties of the Normal distribution

- the mean $\mu$ can be any value, positive or negative
- the standard deviation $\sigma$ must be a positive number
- the mean is equal to the median (both = $\mu$)
- the standard deviation captures the spread of the distribution
- the height of the curve at each point represents the probability of observing that value (however we never calculate probabilities for an exact value, only for ranges...why?)
- the area under the Normal distribution is equal to 1 (i.e., it is a density function)
- a Normal distribution is completely determined by its $\mu$ and $\sigma$

## The 68-95-99.7 rule

### The 68-95-99.7 rule for approximation in all Normal distributions

- Approximately 68% of the data fall within one standard deviation of the mean
- Approximately 95% of the data fall within two standard deviations of the mean
- Approximately 99.7% of the data fall within three standard deviations of the mean

Written probabilistically:

- $P(\mu - \sigma < X < \mu + \sigma) \approx 68\%$
- $P(\mu - 2\sigma < X < \mu + 2\sigma) \approx 95\%$
- $P(\mu - 3\sigma < X < \mu + 3\sigma) \approx 99.7\%$

###  Calculations using the 68-95-99.7 rule
Remembering that the normal curve is symmetric we then also know:

- $P(X < \mu - \sigma) \approx 16\%$ 
- $P(X > \mu + \sigma) \approx 16\%$ 
- $P(X < \mu - 2\sigma) \approx 2.5\%$
- $P(X > \mu + 2\sigma) \approx 2.5\%$
- $P(X < \mu - 3\sigma ) \approx .15\%$
- $P(X > \mu - 3\sigma ) \approx .15\%$

### Calculations using the 68-95-99.7 rule

Example 11.1 from Baldi & Moore on the heights of young women. The distribution 
of heights of young women is approximately Normal, with mean $\mu=64.5$ inches 
and standard deviation $\sigma=2.5$ inches.
- i.e., $H \sim N(64.5, 2.5)$, where H is defined as the height of a young woman

```{r, echo=F, out.width="70%"}

### Calculations using the 68-95-99.7 rule
$\mu=64.5$ inches and standard deviation $\sigma=2.5$ inches

- What calculations could you do with just the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ values and this rule?

- P(62 < H < 67) = ?
- P(H > 62) = ?

- Thinking back to the article about height - who would we consider "taller than normal" in these data?

## Finding Normal probabilities

### Finding Normal probabilities

- A cumulative probability for a value x in a distribution is the proportion of 
observations in the distribution that lie at or below x.
- Here is the cumulative probability for x=1.2

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=F}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(-4, 1.2)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.2, xend = 1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + 
  labs(y = "density")
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

- Recall that 100% of the sample space for the random variable x lies under the 
probability density function.
- What is the amount of the area that is below x = 1.2?
- To answer this question we use the `pnorm()` function:

```{r cumulative-prob-below}
pnorm(q = 1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

What if we wanted the reverse: P(x>1.2)?

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=F}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(1.2, 4)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.2, xend = 1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + labs(y = "density")
```

```{r probability-above}
1 - pnorm(q = 1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Alternatively: 

```{r alternative-prob-above}
 pnorm(q = 1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = F)
```

So, 11.51% of the data is above x=1.2.

### Finding Normal probabilities

What if we wanted two "tail" probabilities?: $P(x< -1.2 \text{ or } x>1.2)$?

```{r, echo=F, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(1.2, 4)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(-4, -1.2)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.2, xend = 1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  geom_segment(x = -1.2, xend = -1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + labs(y = "density")
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

The trick: find one of the tails and then double the area because the distribution
is symmetric:

```{r}
pnorm(q = -1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1)*2
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

What if we wanted a range in the middle?: $P(-0.8 < x < 1.5)$?

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(-0.8, 1.5)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.5, xend = 1.5, y = 0 , yend = 0.13) + 
  geom_segment(x = -0.8, xend = -0.8, y = 0 , yend = 0.29) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + labs(y = "density")
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

```{r steps}
# step 1: calculate the probability *below* the upper bound (x=1.5)
pnorm(q = 1.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
# step 2: calculate the probability *below* the lower bound (x = -0.8)
pnorm(q = -0.8, mean = 0, sd = 1)
# step 3: take the difference between these probabilities 
pnorm(q = 1.5, mean = 0, sd = 1) - pnorm(q = -0.8, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Thus, 72.13% of the data is in the range -0.8 < x < 1.5.

### Your turn 

To diagnose osteoporosis, bone mineral density is measured. The WHO criterion for 
osteoporosis is a BMD score below -2.5. Women in their 70s have a much lower BMD
than younger women. Their BMD ~ N(-2, 1). What proportion of these women have a
BMD below the WHO cutoff?

```{r osteoporosis, echo=FALSE}
#to fill in during class

pnorm(q=-2.5, mean=-2, sd= 1 )
```


## Finding Normal percentiles

### Finding Normal percentiles

Recap: so far, we have calculated the *probability* using `pnorm()` given 
specific values for x.

Sometimes we want to go in the opposite direction: We might be given the 
probability within some range and tasked with finding the corresponding x-values.

### Finding Normal percentiles

Example: The hatching weights of commercial chickens can be modeled accurately
using a Normal distribution with mean $\mu=45$ grams and standard deviation 
$\sigma=4$ grams. What is the third quartile of the distribution of hatching 
weights?

```{r, echo=F, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(29, 61)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 45, sd = 4), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(29, 47.7)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 45, sd = 4)) +
  geom_segment(x = 47.69796, xend = 47.69796, y = 0 , yend = 0.08) + 
  labs(y = "density") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 44, y = 0.05), check_overlap = T, label = "75%", col = "white", size = 8) 
```

### Finding Normal percentiles using the `qnorm()` function

Example: The hatching weights of commercial chickens can be modeled accurately
using a Normal distribution with mean $\mu=45$ grams and standard deviation 
$\sigma=4$ grams. What is the third quartile of the distribution of hatching 
weights?

```{r}
qnorm(p = 0.75, mean = 45, sd = 4)
```

Thus, 75% of the data is below 47.7 for this distribution.


## The standard normal and Z scores

### Convert to a standard
A normal distribution can have an infinite number of possible values for its mean and sd. 

It would be impossible to tabulate the area associated with each and every normal curve

So instead of doing the impossible, we convert to the **Standard Normal** Distribution
 
### The standard Normal distribution
- The standard Normal distribution N(0,1) has $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma=1$.
- $X \sim N(0,1)$, implies that the random variable X is Normally distributed.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="75%"}
p1 <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), col = "orange") +
  labs(y = "density", x = "") + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 0, y = 0.45), label = "mean = 0 \nsd = 1", check_overlap = T, col = "orange") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0 , y = 0, xend = 0, yend = 0.4)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1 , y = 0, xend = 1, yend = 0.25), lty = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1 , y = 0, xend = -1, yend = 0.25), lty = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2 , y = 0, xend = 2, yend = 0.05), lty = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -2 , y = 0, xend = -2, yend = 0.05), lty = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -3:3, 
                     labels = c(-3, "-2\n-2 SD", "-1\n-1 SD", "0\nmean", "1\n+1 SD", "2\n+2 SD", 3))
p1
```

### Standardizing Normally distributed data

- Any random variable that follows a Normal distribution can be standardized
- If $x$ is an observation from a distribution that has a mean $\mu$ and a 
standard deviation $\sigma$, 

$$z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
   
### What's the Z 

By converting our variable of interest $X$ to $Z$ we can use the probabilities of the standard normal probability distribution to estimate the probabilities associated with $X$.

- A standardized value is often called a **z-score**
- Interpretation: $z$ is the number of standard deviations that $x$ is above or
below the mean of the data.

## Simulating Normally distributed data in R

### Simulating Normally distributed data in R

Suppose that we measured 1000 heights for young women:

```{r simulate-height-data}
#students, rnorm() is important to know!
heights.women <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 64.5, sd = 2.5)
heights.women <- data.frame(heights.women)
```

### Simulating Normally distributed data in R
We can plot the histogram of the heights, and see that they roughly follow from
a Normal distribution:

```{r plot heights, out.width="80%", echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
hist <- ggplot(heights.women, aes(x = heights.women)) + geom_histogram(col = "white") + theme_minimal(base_size = 15) 

dens <- ggplot(heights.women, aes(x = heights.women)) + geom_density() + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = 64.5, sd = 2.5), col = "forest green") + theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

hist + dens + plot_layout()
```

### Standardizing Normally distributed data in R

To standard these data, we can apply the formula to compute the z-value:

```{r compute-z-value}
heights.women <- heights.women %>% mutate(mean = mean(heights.women), 
                                          sd = sd(heights.women), 
                                          z = (heights.women - mean)/sd)

head(heights.women)
```

What would the distribution of the standardized heights look like?

### Standardizing Normally distributed data in R

```{r plot-z-scores, warning=F, message=F, out.width="80%", echo=F, }

### Recap of functions used

- `rnorm(n = 100, mean = 2, sd = 0.4)`, to generate Normally distributed data 
from the specified distribution
- `pnorm(q = 1.2, mean = 0, sd = 2)`, to calculate the cumulative probability below
a given value
- `qnorm(p = 0.75, mean = 0, sd = 1)` to calculate the x-value for which some 
percent of the data lies below it
