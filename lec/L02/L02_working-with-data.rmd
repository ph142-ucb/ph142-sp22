## So you have some DATA - now what?

### Learning objectives for today:

1. What is a data frame
2. Get the data into R
3. Figure out what's in the dataset
 - Identifying the unit of analysis 
 - Differentiating between the types of variables

4. Manipulate the data frame using the R package `dplyr`'s main functions:
    - `rename()`
    - `select()`
    - `arrange()`
    - `filter()`
    - `mutate()`
    - `group_by()`
    - `summarize()`

### What is a data frame?

- A data frame is a data set. 
- We read data into R from common sources like Excel spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx), 
    text files (.txt), comma separate value files (.csv), and other formats.
- The simplest format of data contains one row for each individual in the study. 
- The first column of the data identifies the **individual** (perhaps by a name or an ID **variable**). 
- Subsequent columns are **variables** that have been recorded or measured.

### Lake data from Baldi and Moore (B&M)

- Exercise 1.25 from Edition 4 of B&M
- Data from a study of mercury concentration across 53 lakes 
- I've placed these data in my working directory 
- Let's find it there

### readr is a library to import data into R

- To access readr's functions we load the library like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
```

- Click the green arrow to run the code 
- A green rectangle that temporarily appears next to the code shows you that it 
has run.

### `read_csv()` to load the lake data in R
- `read_csv()` is a function from the `readr` library used to import csv files.
- code template: `your_data <- read_csv("pathway_to_data.csv")`
- The `<-` is called the **assignment operator**. It says to save the imported
data into an object called `your_data`.

```{r read-lake-data, message=FALSE}
lake_data <- read_csv("mercury-lake.csv")
```

### Exercise

1. Execute the above code using either the green arrow 
2. Note that the data appears in the Environment pane in the top right. 
   - Notice the number of **observations** and the number of **variables**. 
3. Click the tiny table icon to the right of the `lake_data` in the Environment 
pane to open the **Viewer** tab and inspect the data.


## Describing your data:  what are you working with?

### Four R functions to get to know a dataset

* `head(your_data)`: Shows the first six rows of the supplied dataset
* `dim(your_data)`: Provides the number of rows by the number of columns
* `names(your_data)`: Lists the variable names of the columns in the dataset
* `str(your_data)`: Summarizes the above information and more


```{r head-lake-data}
# notice that if I put a # in front of a line of code it will not run
#head(lake_data)
#dim(lake_data)
#names(lake_data)
str(lake_data)
```

### Unit of analysis
The unit of analysis is the major entity you are working with:

 - Bacteria
 - Laboratory test results
 - Individual People
 - Groups of people (couples, households)
 - Villages
 - Countries
 
 Which function in R lets us know how many units we have?
 

### Type of Variable

- **Categorical** variable: A variable that has grouping levels. Mathematically you can calculate the proportion (%) of individuals in each level of the category.
    - **Nominal** variables: have no underlying order or rank. E.g., hospital ID, HIV status (yes/no variables), race  
    - **Ordinal** variables: can be ordered or ranked. E.g., socio-economic status, BMI categories

- **Quantitative** variable: A continuous, numeric variable that you can perform mathematical operations on. Mathematically, we can you take the median or average of these variables
    - **Discrete** variables: can be counted. E.g., number of brain lesions, number of previous births
    - **Continuous** variables: can be measured precisely, with a ruler or scale. E.g, annual income, blood alcohol content, gestational age at birth

## Participation Question

## dplyr functions for data manipulation

### Using `dplyr` functions for data manipulation {.bigger} 

- `rename()`
- `select()`
- `arrange()`
- `filter()`
- `mutate()`
- `group_by()`
- `summarize()`

### Load the `dplyr` library to access the functions

```{r load-dplyr}
library(dplyr)
```

- These messages mean that some functions (e.g., filter()) share names with 
functions from other libraries. So, when we use `filter()` we will now use the
`dplyr` version because the `stats` library version has been masked.

- essentially "masking" means that a function is covered over, or masked by a more recently loaded function.

### Function 1: rename()

What do you think rename does?

First print the names of the variables:
```{r print-variable-names}
names(lake_data)
```

Run the rename() function and assign it to `lake_data_tidy`:
```{r}
lake_data_tidy <- rename(lake_data, name_of_lake = lakes)
```

### Function 1: rename()
Then reprint the variable names:
```{r}
names(lake_data_tidy)
```

### Function 1: rename() multiple variables at once

You can rename multiple variables at once:

```{r rename-two-variables}
lake_data_tidy <- rename(lake_data, 
                         name_of_lake = lakes, 
                         ph_level = ph)
```

### Code template for rename() function

`new_dataset <- rename(old_dataset, new_name = old_name)`

Another way to write the above code is to use the **pipe** operator: `%>%`

`new_dataset <- old_dataset %>% rename(new_name = old_name)`

The pipe will become very useful in a few slides...

### Function 2: select()

Based on the output below, what do you think `select()` does? 

```{r select-first-three}
smaller_data <- select(lake_data, lakes, ph, chlorophyll)
names(smaller_data)
```

### Function 2: select()

* We use `select()` to select a subset of **variables**. 
* This is very handy if we inherit a large dataset with several variables that
we do not need.

### Function 2: "negative select()"

We can also use "negative `select()`" to deselect variables. Suppose we wanted
to keep all variables except for `age_data`:

```{r deselect-last-variable}
smaller_data_2 <- select(lake_data, - age_data)
names(smaller_data_2)
```

We place a negative sign in front of `age_data` to remove it from the dataset.

### Rewrite using the pipe operator

```{r}
smaller_data <- lake_data %>% select(lakes, ph, chlorophyll)
smaller_data_2 <- lake_data %>% select(- age_data)
```

* Going forward, we will use the pipe operator to write code using any `dplyr` functions
* This is because we can use the pipe to stack many `dplyr` functions in a row

### Function 3: arrange()

What does arrange do? First type `View(lake_data)` to look at the original data. Then 
run the code and examine its output below. What is different?:

```{r arrange-ph}
View(lake_data)
lake_data %>% arrange(ph)
```

### Function 3: arrange() in descending order

```{r arrange-neg-ph}
lake_data %>% arrange(- ph)
```

### Function 3: arrange() by two variables

```{r arrange-age-and-ph}
lake_data %>% arrange(age_data, -ph)
```

### Function 4: mutate()

- **`mutate()` is one of the most useful functions!** 
- It is used to add new variables to the dataset. Suppose that someone told you 
that the number of fish sampled was actually in hundreds, such that 5 is actually 500. You can use mutate to add a new variable to your dataset that is in the hundreds:

```{r mutate-fish-count}
lake_data_new_fish <- lake_data %>% 
  mutate(actual_fish_sampled = number_fish * 100)

lake_data_new_fish
```

### Use `%>%` to append several lines of code together
- We have saved many of new datasets in our environment! 
- If these datasets were larger, they would take up a lot of space. 
- Rather than saving a new dataset each time, we can make successive changes
to one dataset like this:

```{r rename-select-and-mutate}
tidy_lake_data <- lake_data %>% 
  rename(name_of_lake = lakes) %>%
  mutate(actual_fish_sampled = number_fish * 100) %>%
  select(- age_data, - number_fish)
tidy_lake_data
```

- When you see "%>%", say the words "and then...". For example, "Take `lake_data` and then rename `lakes` to name_of_lake, and then mutate..."

### Use `%>%` to "pipe" several lines of code together

```{r rename-select-and-mutate-eval}
tidy_lake_data <- lake_data %>%
  rename(lake_name = lakes) %>%
  mutate(actual_fish_sampled = number_fish * 100) %>%
  select(- age_data, - number_fish)

#tidy_lake_data
```

### Function 5: `filter()`

Filter is another very useful function! What might `filter()` do? 

### Function 5: `filter()`ing on numeric variables
We use filter to select which rows we want to keep in the dataset. Suppose you were only interested in lakes with `ph` levels of 7 or higher.

```{r filter-on-ph}
lake_data_filtered <- lake_data %>% filter(ph > 7)
lake_data_filtered
```


### Function 5: `filter()`ing on character/string variables

Let's try a few more ways to `filter()` the data set since subsetting data is so 
important:

```{r filter-on-recent}
lake_data %>% filter(age_data == "recent")
```

- `==` is read as "is equal to"


### Function 5: `filter()`ing on character/string variables

```{r filter-not-on-recent}
lake_data %>% filter(age_data != "recent") 
```

- `!=` is read as "is not equal to"

### Function 5: `filter()`ing on character/string variables

```{r filter-on-name}
lake_data %>% filter(lakes %in% c("Alligator", "Blue Cypress")) 
```

- `%in%` is the "in" operator. We are selecting rows where the variable `lakes` 
belongs to the specified list.
- The `c()` combines "Alligator" and "Blue Cypress" into a list

### Function 5: multiple `filter()`s at once
```{r filter-multiple}
lake_data %>% filter(ph > 6, chlorophyll > 30)

#this is the same as:
lake_data %>% filter(ph > 6 & chlorophyll > 30)
```

- A comma or the "and" operator (`&`) are equivalent. Here they say, filter the dataset and keep only rows with `ph > 6` AND `chlorophyll > 30`

### Function 5: `filter()` using "or"
```{r filter-multiple-OR}
lake_data %>% filter(ph > 6 | chlorophyll > 30)
```

- `|` is the OR operator. At least one of `ph > 6` or `chlorophyll > 30` needs 
to be true.

### Functions 6 and 7: group_by() and summarize()

Let's execute the following code and see what it does.

```{r group_by-and-mean}
lake_data %>% 
  group_by(age_data) %>% 
  summarize(mean_ph = mean(ph))
```

What happened?

### Functions 6 and 7: group_by() and summarize()

Another one:

```{r group_by-and-mean-sd}
lake_data %>% 
  group_by(age_data) %>% 
  summarize(mean_ph = mean(ph),
            standard_deviation_ph = sd(ph))
```

### Recap: What functions did we use?

1. `library()` to load `readr` and `dplyr`.
2. `read_csv()` to read csv files from a directory.
3. `head()`, `str()`, `dim()`, and `names()` to look at our imported data.
4. `rename()` to rename variables in a data frame.
5. `select()` to select a subset of variables.
6. `arrange()` to sort a dataset according to one or more variables.
7. `mutate()` to create new variables.
8. `filter()` to select a subset of rows.
9. `group_by() and summarize()` to group the data by a categorial variable and 
calculate a statistic.
10. `mean()` and `sd()` to calculate the mean and standard deviation of variables.

### Recap: What operators did we use?

1. Assignment arrow: `<-`: This is our most important operator!
2. Greater than: `>` There are also: 
    - Less than: `<`
    - Greater than or equal to: `>=`, and,
    - Less than or equal to: `<=` 
4. Is equal to: `==`, and `!=` is not equal to
5. `%in%` to select from a list, where the list is created using `c()`, i.e., 
`lakes %in% c("Alligator", "Annie")`
