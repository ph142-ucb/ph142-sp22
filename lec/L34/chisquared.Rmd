### Air pollution regulations
from the [NYtimes April 14 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/opinion/air-pollution-trump.html) op-ed:

In 2019, a reconstituted panel of science advisers to the E.P.A., the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, sharply questioned the agency’s longstanding position that particulate pollution is causally linked with premature death, and it called for a new assessment of the pollutant. In a letter to the E.P.A. administrator, Andrew Wheeler, the committee’s chairman, Louis Anthony Cox Jr., said the agency had not provided “a sufficiently comprehensive, systematic assessment of the available science.”

### Air pollution regulations

The Environmental Protection Agency’s own website said at the time: “Numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of problems, including: premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, increased respiratory symptoms.”

### Air pollution regulations
All Epidemiologists had been removed from the panel and epidemiologic evidence was being dismissed.

What is the argument against Epidemiology here?

In our framework (PPDAC) what kind of a problem is this? 

How would you approach this problem? 
Would it be possible to do a randomized controlled trial in this case?

### Air pollution regulations
Example study
from JAMA 2017 Dec 26; 318(24): 2446–2456.
Association of Short-Term Exposure to Air Pollution with Mortality in Older Adults, Di et al.

-  entire Medicare population from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012, residing in 39,182 zip codes
- looked at mortality on days when air pollution was higher vs lower

## Recap of Chi-squared

### Recap

- Last class we learned about the chi-square $\chi^2$ test
- We used the test to look at the distribution of one categorical variable to
test the null hypothesis 

$$H_0: p_1=\#_1, p_2=\#_2, ..., p_k=\#_k$$

where $\#_1$, $\#_2$, ..., $\#_k$ were provided in the question.

- This test is called the **chi-square goodness of fit test**
    - How good do the expected counts "fit" the observed counts?

### Recap of the chi-square goodness of fit test (for one categorical variable)

- The chi-square test statistic (Or, the "Old McDonald" test statistic: "E-i, E-i, O!"):

$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k\frac{(E_i-O_i)^2}{E_i}$$

### Parametric vs non-parametric

Is chi-squared parametric?  Why?  


### Today's lecture

- We can also use the chi-square test to investigate the relationship 
between two categorical variables
- The form of the test statistic is the same!

### Think back to Chapter 5...

- In Chapter 5, we learned about two-way tables and talked about how to calculate
the conditional probability of one variable given another.

- For example, what is the conditional probability of lung cancer among smokers 
vs. among non-smokers?

- Recall also the definition of **explanatory** and **response** variables. In 
the case of smoking and lung cancer, which was explanatory and which was 
response?

### Hypotheses for the chi-square test for two categorical variables

- $H_0:$ Response and explanatory variables are independent.

Stated another way:

- $H_0:$ The probability distribution for lung cancer among smokers is equal to the
probability distribution among non-smokers

- If you remember our probability independence rules P(A|B)=P(A)...how does this apply here?

Alternative hypothesis:

- $H_a:$ Response and explanatory variables are dependent.
- $H_a:$ The probability distribution for lung cancer among smokers is different
from the probability among non-smokers.
    - The alternative hypothesis is not one-sided or two-sided. It is non-specific 
and allows for any kind of difference from the null. Does this mean we look at 2 sides of the distribution?

### Chi-square test of independence

- Just like last class, we compare observed cell counts (**$O_i$**) to expected 
cell counts (**$E_i$**), but this time we have a two-way table showing the 
distribution of data across two variables.

### Steps of the chi-squared test based on these data.

1. Make the two-way table.
2. Calculate the expected values.
3. Calculate the test statistic.
4. Calculate the degrees of freedom and p-value.
5. Interpret the p-value and assess the evidence.

Also: assess whether the conditions are met to conduct the test.

### Sample size conditions for the chi-square test of independence

- $E_i \geq 5$ for at least 80% of the cells
- All $E_i > 1$
- If table is 2X2, all four cells need $E_i\geq 5$

### Statistical assumptions for the chi-square test of independence

Must have either data arising from:

- Independent SRSs from $\geq$ 2 populations, with each individual classified 
according to one category (i.e., each individual can only belong to one cell in
the table so the categories need to be mutually exclusive)

- A single SRS, with each individual classified according to each of two categorical
variables.


### Example :  gastroenteritis outbreak
From Gross et al. Public health reports vol 104, March-April 1989, 164-169

|Group        | Sandwich     | No Sandwich   | Row total |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
|Ill          | 109          |  4            | 113       |
|Not Ill      | 116          | 34            | 150       |
|Column total | 225          | 38            | 263       |

- The inner four cells are the observed cell counts
- The outer row and column are the table **margins**
- The margins are important for the computations, so be sure to calculate the
marginal counts if they aren't computed for you.

### Example :  gastroenteritis outbreak

|Group        | Sandwich     | No Sandwich   | Row total |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
|Ill          | 109          |  4            | 113       |
|Not Ill      | 116          | 34            | 150       |
|Column total | 225          | 38            | 263       |

- What would these data look like under the null hypothesis of no association
between sandwiches and getting sick?
- That is, what are the expected counts under the null hypothesis?

### Example :  gastroenteritis outbreak
To help us get the expected counts, calculate the marginal percentages 
and remove the data from the inner cells

|Group        | Sandwich     | No Sandwich   | Row total |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
|Ill          | ?            |  ?            | 113  (43%)|
|Not Ill      | ?            |  ?            | 150  (57%)|
|Column total | 225 (85.6%)  | 38 (14.4%)    | 263       |


- Recall that if $A$ and $B$ are independent then $P(A \& B)=P(A)P(B)$. That is,
if sandwiches and illness are independent, then $P(Sandwich \& Illness) = P(S)P(I)=.855*.43 =.368 =36.8\%$

- What is the expected count for the S&I cell under the null hypothesis?
    - 0.368*263 = 96.7
    
### Example :  gastroenteritis outbreak

- What is the expected count for the S&I cell under the null hypothesis?
     - 0.368*263 = 96.7

|Group        | Sandwich     | No Sandwich   | Row total |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
|Ill          |96.7          |  16.3         | 113  (43%)|
|Not Ill      | 128.3        |  21.7         | 150  (57%)|
|Column total | 225 (85.6%)  | 38 (14.4%)    | 263       |

- What are the expected counts for the other cells under $H_0$?
    - S' & I: $0.144 \times 0.43\times 263$
    - S & I': $0.856 \times 0.57\times 263$
    - S' & I': $0.144 \times 0.57 \times 263$
    
- Note that once you compute two of the cells you can use subtraction from the 
marginal counts to get the other two values. Thus, only do as much calculation
as you need and then get the rest by subtracting from the margins.

### A trick for calculating the expected counts

- On the previous slides, we first calculated the marginal probabilities and
multiplied them together and with the sample size to calculate the expected counts.
- We started with this calculation so you could see the intuition for why it worked.
- But there is a quicker way!:

$$E_i =\frac{\text{row total}\times\text{col total}}{\text{overall total}}$$

### A trick for calculating the expected counts
Worked calculations:

- S&I = 225*113/263 = 96.7
- S&I' = 225*150/263 = 128.3
- S'&I = 38*113/263 = 16.3
- S'&I' = 38*150/263 = 21.7
- **Use this trick for faster calculation**

### Compare $E_i$ and $O_i$

|Group         | Sandwich         | No Sandwich        | 
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|
|Ill          | E=96.7 vs. O=109  | E=16.3 vs. O=4     | 
|Not Ill      | E=128.3 vs. O=116 | E=21.7 vs. O=34    |

- Think about the direction of the deviations. When is the observed higher than
the expected? When is it the other way around? Does this jibe with the association
you're expecting?

### Calculate the chi-square test statistic

$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k\frac{(E_i-O_i)^2}{E_i}$

$\chi^2 = \frac{(96.7-109)^2}{96.7} + \frac{(16.3-4)^2}{16.3} + \frac{(128.3-116)^2}{128.3} + \frac{(21.7-34)^2}{21.7}$

$\chi^2 = 1.5645+9.2816+1.1792+6.972=18.9973$

### Calculate the degrees of freedom

- Like last class, we need a degrees of freedom for the test statistic.
- When we only had one variable the degrees of freedom equaled $k-1$
- Here we have two variables. The degrees of freedom equals $(r-1)(c-1)$, where
$r$ is the number of inner row cells and $c$ is the number of inner 
column cells (here $r=2$ and $c=2$)
- For these data, df = (2-1)(2-1) = 1

### Calculate the p-value for the chi-square test

```{r calc-p-value}
pchisq(q = 18.9972, df = 1, lower.tail = F) #df = (2-1)(2-1) = 1
```

- **Remember for the chi-squared test we always do an upper tail test!**

Interpret the p-value: Assuming no association between sandwiches and illness,
there is less than a 0.01% chance of the chi-square value we calculated or a larger one.
This probability is small enough that there is evidence in favor of the 
alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship between sandwiches and illness.

## Chi-squared test of independence in R

### Chi-square test of independence in R

To compute the chi-square test in R, we need to first put this two-way table into a
data frame:
```{r}
library(tibble)
two_way <- tribble(~ sandwich, ~ nosandwich,
                     109,        4, #row for Illness
                     116,         34) #row for no Illness
```

### Chi-square test of independence in R

Then, we use `chisq.test()`. We set `correct=F` to get a value closer to what we
calculated by hand - there will be some differences here  because of rounding:

```{r}
chisq.test(two_way, correct = F) #not using Yates' correction for continuity
```

## Yates' continuity correction

### Continuity correction 
- The $\chi^2$ is a continuous distribution and we are using discrete observations to estimate a $\chi^2$ value.
- When there are many degrees of freedom and/or a large number of observations, this is a reasonable approximation
- In a 2x2 table (df=1) with a small sample size this may be less reasonable.
- The correction looks like this $$\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{(|E_i-O_i|-0.5)^2}{E_i}$$
What do you thing this will do to the $\chi^2$ value?

### Chi-square test of independence in R

Compare to the result where `correct = T` (the default with correction):

```{r}
chisq.test(two_way, correct = T) #using Yates' correction for continuity
```

- A common practice is to incorporate the Yate's continuity correction when
n < 100 or any O_i < 10. [Reference](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/statistics-square-one/8-chi-squared-tests)


### Relationship between the chi-square test and the two-sample z test

- The topic of upcoming lab. 

## Extending the 2 X 2 to a more generic R X C

### Extending the 2 X 2 to a more generic R X C
- we have looked at 2 x 2 as an example of how you would compare two categorical variables
- 2 X 2 tables are common as many variables that we look at are classified as binary 
- however the chi-squared test works the same way for variables with more than 2 categories

### Another example: HPV Status and age group

Suppose you had these data of HPV status vs. age group. 

|Age Group    | HPV +        | HPV -          | Row total   |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
|14-19        | 160          | 492            | 652 (33.9%) |
|20-24        | 85           | 104            | 189 (9.8%)  |
|25-29        | 48           | 126            | 174 (9.1%)  |
|30-39        | 90           | 238            | 328 (17.1%) |
|40-49        | 82           | 242            | 324 (16.9%) |
|50-59        | 50           | 204            | 254 (13.2%) |
| Col total   | 515 (26.8%)  | 1406 (73.2%)   | 1921        |

- Which variable is explanatory and which is response?
- Can you formulate a null and alternative hypothesis using these data?

### Welcome back to the dodged histogram

- Recall that we used dodged histograms to compare the conditional distribution 
of one variable across the levels of another variable.
- These plots are useful to make before we conduct the hypothesis test.

Remember the syntax:
 geom_bar(aes(fill = **outcome**), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
 
The "identity" option tells R that the values are already calculated


### Welcome back to the dodged histogram
Is there visual evidence of a difference between the conditional distribution of HPV status by age group?
```{r chpv, echo=F, out.width="75%", fig.align=T, message=F}
age.group <- rep(c("14-19", "20-24", "25-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59"), 2)
hpv.test <- c(rep("positive", 6), rep("negative", 6))
number.of.women <- c(160, 85, 48, 90, 82, 50, 
                     492, 104, 126, 238, 242, 204)

hpv.data <- data.frame(age.group, hpv.test, number.of.women)

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
hpv.data <- hpv.data %>% group_by(hpv.test) %>% 
  mutate(sum.women = sum(number.of.women),
         prop.women.age = number.of.women/sum.women)

ggplot(hpv.data, aes(x = age.group, y = prop.women.age)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = hpv.test), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  labs(y = "Proportion", x = "Age", main = "Conditional distribution of age by HPV status")
```

### Example: HPV Status and age group

- Conduct all stages of the chi-square hypothesis test for independence (state
the null and alternative hypotheses, calculate the test statistic, calculate
the degrees of freedom and the p-value, interpret the p-value and assess whether
there is evidence against the null in favor of the alternative.)

### Example: HPV Status and age group
```{r}
pchisq(40.55353, df=5, lower.tail=F)
```

### Example: HPV Status and age group
```{r}
library(tibble)
n_way <- tribble(~ HPV, ~ noHPV,
                   160,492,
                   85,104,
                   48,126,
                   90,238,
                   82,242,
                   50,204) 
chisq.test(n_way, correct=F)
```
