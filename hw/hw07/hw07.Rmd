### Instructions 
* Solutions will be released on Tuesday, March 15th.
* This semester, homework assignments are for practice only and will not be turned in for marks.

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit correctly before submitting.**

- It is good practice to not allow your code to run off the page. To avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the file. If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

## Part I: Confidence Intervals

Deer mice are small rodents native in North America. Their adult body lengths (excluding tail) are known to vary approximately Normally, with mean $\mu=86$ mm and standard deviation $\sigma=8$ mm. It is suspected that depending on their  environment, deer mice may adapt and deviate from these usual lengths. A random  sample of $n=14$ deer mice in a rich forest habitat gives an average body length  of $\bar{x}=91.1$ mm. Assume that the standard deviation $\sigma$ of all deer mice in this area is 8 mm. 

**1. Calculate a 99% confidence interval based on this information (you can use R as a calculator to perform the calculation, or use a hand calculator). Round your final values to three decimal places.**

```{r}
lower_tail <- 'REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND'
upper_tail <- 'REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE UPPER BOUND'
ci_99 <- c(lower_tail, upper_tail)



# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p1.R")
```

**2. Interpret the confidence interval from question 1 in the context of this question.**

\newpage

**3. Suppose deer mice researchers thought your CI was too wide to be useful. Given that you cannot change the standard deviation, what two things could you do to provide a narrower confidence interval?**

\newpage

**4. You decide to create a 95% confidence interval, rather than a 99% confidence interval. Perform this calculation below and round your answer to 3 decimal places.**

```{r CI95-rodents}
lower_tail95 <- 'REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND'
upper_tail95 <- 'REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE UPPER BOUND'
ci_95 <- c(lower_tail95, upper_tail95)


# YOUR CODE HERE

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p4.R")
```

\newpage

**5. Based on this 95% CI, is there evidence against the hypothesis $H_0$ that these mice have a significantly different mean length compared to the population described in the first part of the question? Without performing a calculation, what amounts do you know the p-value to be bounded between for a two-sided hypothesis test of $H_0$?** 

*Hint: Use information from questions 1 and 4.*

**We want to perform a z-test with the two-sided alternative hypothesis the true mean length is not equal to 86mm. In the next four problems, we will conduct a z-test step by step.**

**6. Write the null and alternative hypotheses for the question above.**

**7. Calculate the z test statistic. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.**

```{r calc-z-stat}

z_stat <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
z_stat


# YOUR CODE HERE

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p7.R")
```

\newpage

**8. Calculate the p-value as a decimal. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.**

```{r calc-p-val}

p_val <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p_val


# YOUR CODE HERE

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p8.R")
```

## Part II: Proportions

Suppose we want to estimate the proportion of Americans who would be willing to get a vaccine for a new strain of COVID-19. We interview a random sample of 100 Americans about whether they would choose to be vaccinated if it were an option. Unknown to us, the true population proportion of those would be vaccinated is 0.50. 

*Note: This sample proportion is only an estimate but reflects the proportion of Americans willing to accept the hypothetical vaccine in a recent study.*

**10. What is the expected value and the standard error of the sample proportion?**

**11. Which of the following is an appropriate statement of the central limit theorem? Select just one.**


  (a) The central limit theorem states that if you take a large random sample from a population and the data in the population are normally distributed, the data in your sample will be normally distributed.
  
  (b) The central limit theorem states that if you take a large random sample from a population, the data in your sample will be normally distributed.
 
  (c) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population and the data in the population are normally distributed, the sample means will be normally distributed.
  
  (d) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population, the sample means will be normally distributed.
 
  (e) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population and the data in the population are normally distributed, the data from the pooled samples will be normally distributed.
  
  (f) The central limit theorem states that if you take many large random samples from a population, the data from the pooled samples will be normally distributed.

Read the 2001 reprint of the 1985 article "Sick Individuals and Sick Populations" by Geoffrey Rose.

Some things to think about from this article.

**13. What is the issue Rose highlights with exposures that are very common in a population?**

**14. What are the differences in how the high risk vs population strategies affect the distribution?**

**15. The ban on smoking in public places (restaurants, bars, etc.) was argued legally based on the rights of staff in these locations to be free of second hand smoke. The impact has been a shift in the curve of tobacco exposure, smoking and smoking related health outcomes. Name another type or example of an intervention that has been promoted recently (for any outcome) based on this idea of shifting the curve in the population.**
